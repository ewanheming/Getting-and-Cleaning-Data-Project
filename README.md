Getting and Cleaning Data Project
=================================
I have split the functions for this project into the following files:

* run_analysis.R: The main script that calls the other functions.
* loadData.R: Merges the data from each of the three files for a data set.
* readActivities: Reads the activities for a data set and turns them into factors.
* renameFields.R: Cleans up the field names.
* processData.R: Aggregates the data for each combination of Subject and Activity.
